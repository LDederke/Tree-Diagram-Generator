This script is a tool to create Tree Diagrams from .xlsx tables. By choosing columns in a specific order, you can set the order of the levels in the diagram. The script will then get all possible combinations of values/attributes to create branches, count the number of records per branch for each level and create a .csv table with an overview of which data record are sorted to each branch. The tree diagram is exported as Shapefile which you can show, label and redesign in any GIS-software e.g. Q-GIS (free open-source). This can be useful to either show your data to someone else, get a quick overview on your data, or choose a sample dataset with special distribution. 

You can set various input parameter such as the box size, the distance between each box and the upper level and the box size of the upper level in "%".

The diagram export as .svg may follow sometime.
